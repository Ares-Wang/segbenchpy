## segbenchpy

This project is a set of utilities and code to evalute edge detection predictions according 
to the berkeley edge detection benchmark [here](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/bsds/code/Benchmark/) from python.
It also extends this benchmark to the 3D case.
Much of the help code is based on [Piotr's edge toolbox](https://github.com/pdollar/edges).
